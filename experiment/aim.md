To understand and simulate the MSI (Modified-Shared-Invalid) cache coherence protocol used in multiprocessor systems. This experiment aims to:

1. **Demonstrate Cache Coherence**: Understand how the MSI protocol maintains data consistency across multiple processor caches in a shared memory multiprocessor system.

2. **Visualize State Transitions**: Observe how cache lines transition between Modified (M), Shared (S), and Invalid (I) states based on processor operations and bus activities.

3. **Analyze Protocol Behavior**: Study the interaction between processor requests (PrRd/PrWr), bus transactions (BusRd/BusRdX/BusUpgr), and cache state changes.

4. **Evaluate Performance Impact**: Examine cache hit/miss ratios and understand how coherence protocol operations affect system performance.

5. **Explore Real-world Applications**: Gain insights into how modern multicore processors maintain cache coherence and the trade-offs involved in different coherence protocols.
